# Summary

 ## The fundamentals of a good developer

* Every developer is suffering from many horror stories and they may affect the software in a negative way


*The points that should every developer master*

 ```

1-Conceiving The Purpose of Software

the purpose of the software to help people and the software shouldnot be complex

2-The Goals of Software Design
when your design be easy for you and helpful for others the program will have along lifetime 

3- (Mis)understanding

to be good developer should understand all the systems and tools you working with

4- Simplicity
the program should be basic until the other programmer read it eaisly

5- Complexity
the good programmer can controlling complexity As a developer,
 your first behavior should be resistance to (unnecessary) change

6-Maintenance: it's a vital phase in software development, that must take into consideration. some developers think that quick coding and fast shipping look more important than code maintenance. but it is not totally true.
 thinking about future maintenance of changes is one of your main responsibilities.

7-Consistency: developer should keep writing code coherence and correspondence.

8-Prioritizing: The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those 
that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.

9-Solving Problems: understanding, planning, dividing are the key to successful problem solving

10-Good enough is fine: perfection should not be a big deal. Developers should stop thinking about perfection
 because chasing it will cost them a lot of time and may raise the complexity. start small, improve it, 
then extend.

11-Predictions:Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.

12-Assumptions: Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.

13-Resistance: changing is the enemy of resistance, however,
 unnecessary changes will increase defects in your software, so make sure to make it when needed.

14-Automation: Avoid repetitive tasks

15-Code measurement: Code lines aren't a good measurement for the software.
 You can achieve simplicity with a little bunch of code and solve the problem.

16-Productivity: simplicity is the major goal of productivity, the less code that you write, 
the more productivity that you will have in your code

17-Testing: You should test your code in each stage to find the problem easily. 
To avoid guessing the source of the bug.

18-(Under)Estimation: when developers divide code into small chunks, the wrong may arise, 
but it will be a lot less than when we have underestimation things.

19-Running Away From Rewriting: There are many cases in that you should consider rewriting your code from scratch.
 but usually, writing code is easier than reading it.

20-Documentation and Commenting: add a comment to explain the complexity

21-Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.):  pick the right technologies for your project.

22-Self-Development: learning haven't any dead end, each day new things show up on the scene, 
you must be updated with these things, try to collect advantage, and learn one thing about everything.

23-Dont be a hero: know your limit, act and write code depending on it. just make what you can and what your effort allows you to do.

24-Dont Ask Questions Ask For Help:  
first try your best to solve the  problems, and then do some search , when you are completely stuck, 
ask from professional to help you.
