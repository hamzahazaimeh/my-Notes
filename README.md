# Summary
Learn the fundamentals of a good developer mindset in 15 minutesEvery developer is suffering from many horror stories and they may affect the software in a negative way. Exploring them may take time and if the developer doesn't notice them at first, they will stack up and the complexity become more. the developer will become a victim of these horror stories. what should a developer do to avoid them? he should develop the mindset that every developer should have and keep the software as simple as possible.the points that should every developer master :

Conceiving The Purpose of Software: the purpose of the software is to help people otherwise it will be considered bad software.
The Goals of Software Design: if you want a long lifetime software, Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.
(Mis)understanding: understand the systems and tools you are working with make you a good developer if not unfortunately you would be a bad developer.
Simplicity: the simplicity centered on writing a simple code, that is understandable to other developers. when you make things more complex and think that you are a genius, the result would be unsatisfactory.
Complexity: understand the purpose of the software before starting coding, to accomplish simplicity. if you didn't pay attention, you start to introduce many new bugs because of the complexity of your code. essential principle should be resistant to (unnecessary) change.
Maintenance: it's a vital phase in software development, that must take into consideration. some developers think that quick coding and fast shipping look more important than code maintenance. but it is not totally true. thinking about future maintenance of changes is one of your main responsibilities.
Consistency: developer should keep writing code coherence and correspondence.
Prioritizing: The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.
Solving Problems: understanding, planning, dividing are the key to successful problem solving
Good enough is fine: perfection should not be a big deal. Developers should stop thinking about perfection because chasing it will cost them a lot of time and may raise the complexity. start small, improve it, then extend.
Predictions: don't think about the future and what may happen because it will become a burden freaks you out, just focus on the meantime requirements.
Assumptions: Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.
Stop Reinventing: don't invent something that already exists, reinvent just If needed.
Resistance: changing is the enemy of resistance, however, unnecessary changes will increase defects in your software, so make sure to make it when needed.
Automation: Avoid repetitive tasks
Code measurement: Code lines aren't a good measurement for the software. You can achieve simplicity with a little bunch of code and solve the problem.
Productivity: simplicity is the major goal of productivity, the less code that you write, the more productivity that you will have in your code
Testing: You should test your code in each stage to find the problem easily. To avoid guessing the source of the bug.
(Under)Estimation: when developers divide code into small chunks, the wrong may arise, but it will be a lot less than when we have underestimation things.
Running Away From Rewriting: There are many cases in that you should consider rewriting your code from scratch. but usually, writing code is easier than reading it.
Documentation and Commenting: If the code isn't obvious you should add a comment to explain the complexity and "why" you did this. It is important to have documentation to explain your software’s architecture and every module and component. This is required to see the high-level picture of your software which it will be easier for new developers to understand the software as a whole
Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.): try to avoid external technologies, bugs may arise, and fixing them may take much time, so it's important to pick the right technologies for your project.
Self-Development: learning haven't any dead end, each day new things show up on the scene, you must be updated with these things, try to collect advantage, and learn one thing about everything.
Don’t be a hero: know your limit, act and write code depending on it, don't focus on the idea of the best developer. just make what you can and what your effort allows you to do.
Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help: don't ask others how to do something, try your best to solve problems, and then discuss with your team leads, when you are completely stuck, ask from professional to help you.
